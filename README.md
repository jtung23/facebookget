# Trending Restaurants Data Collection Scripts

These files were created for the initial data collection and used daily by the Trending Restaurant App:

>[Git Repo](https://github.com/D-J-Trending/trending-restaurants)
>[Site](https://tregg.herokuapp.com/)

daily_data.py is used to update certain fields in the mLab database used by Trending Restaurants as well as add new restaurants if the user added new restaurants.

do_math.py is used daily as well to calculate the score using our propriety algorithm. This data is inserted into the appropriate document for usage on the front-end to show which restaurants are the trendiest.
